## 👋 Hi, I'm aybeeing — Graduate student in AI for Science

I’m currently a graduate student at UCAS (Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences).
My current research areas include graph neural networks, AI for chemistry, and energy-based models.

My vision is to help accelerate the arrival of AGI and use technology to improve everyday life. I approach this from a scientific perspective—exploring AGI from first principles—while keeping a close eye on the latest advances and how to apply them in the real world.

I’m passionate about emerging technologies. Areas I focus on:

- AI
- Blockchain / Crypto
- Agents

## 🧭 Research Interests

Molecular Representation Learning
Graph neural networks, self-orthogonalizing attractor neural networks, energy-based models

AI for Chemistry
Predictive modeling of electronic structure (e.g., HOMO–LUMO gaps), electrolyte design, SEI interphase formation, reaction intermediates.


## 🔬 Ongoing Work

Graph Neural Network Pipelines for Molecular Properties
Developing clean and reproducible pipelines combining RDKit, PyTorch Geometric, and Chemprop; conducting model ablation, hyperparameter tuning, and representation studies.

Agent Development
I’m currently excited about agent projects and am experimenting with building a multi-agent system that collaborates across multiple projects.

## 🧰 Tools & Methods

Python, PyTorch, PyG, RDKit, Chemprop

LLM/Agent frameworks: LangGraph, Dify, custom tool-use pipelines

Data systems: scientific datasets (QM9, QM9-star, PCQM4Mv2, LIBE, MPcules)

Computational chemistry fundamentals: basic DFT workflows, electronic structure descriptors, reaction network analysis

## 📄 Writing & Documentation

My recent work includes literature reviews, structured reading notes, GNN derivations, and technical blog posts on molecular ML pipelines. I aim to make scientific computation more interpretable, reproducible, and accessible.

## 🎯 Long-Term Direction

I aim to explore foundational deep learning architectures toward AGI. By mastering cutting-edge technologies, I hope to gain the freedom to explore technology-driven civilization.

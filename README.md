## 👋 Hi,I'm aybeeing — Graduate Researcher in AI for Science

I’m currently a graduate student at UCAS (Shanghai institute of Organic Chemistry，Chinese Academy of Sciences).
at the interface of computational chemistry, machine learning, and molecular modeling.

I’m a researcher who enjoys building things. I tend to approach problems through implementation—writing small tools, automating workflows, and using code to make both scientific work and daily life more efficient.
Beyond individual projects, I’m motivated by a broader question: how computational systems can evolve toward generality, and how scientific domains such as chemistry, physics, and materials can contribute conceptual building blocks for future AGI.

🧭 Research Interests

Molecular Representation Learning
Graph neural networks, continuous-filter convolutions, Fourier- and wavefunction-inspired embeddings, multi-component graph structures.

AI for Chemistry
Predictive modeling of electronic structure (e.g., HOMO–LUMO gaps), electrolyte design, SEI interphase formation, reaction intermediates.

Large Models in Scientific Workflows
Automated literature structuring, scientific agents, domain-specific RAG, tool-augmented reasoning for chemistry.

🔬 Ongoing Work

Graph Neural Network Pipelines for Molecular Properties
Developing clean and reproducible pipelines combining RDKit, PyTorch Geometric, and Chemprop; conducting model ablation, hyperparameter tuning, and representation studies.

Scientific Agent Systems
Building agent workflows for reading, structuring, and analyzing arXiv papers; integrating long-context LLMs, citation extraction, and experimental reproducibility checks.

SEI Chemistry & Electrolyte Modeling
Reviewing mechanistic pathways in SEI formation, exploring data-driven reactivity prediction using energetic and electronic descriptors.

🧰 Tools & Methods

Python, PyTorch, PyG, RDKit, Chemprop

LLM/Agent frameworks: LangGraph, Dify, custom tool-use pipelines

Data systems: YAML/JSON configs, scientific datasets (QM9, QM9-star, PCQM4Mv2, LIBE, MPcules)

Computational chemistry fundamentals: basic DFT workflows, electronic structure descriptors, reaction network analysis

📄 Writing & Documentation

My recent work includes literature reviews, structured reading notes, GNN derivations, and technical blog posts on molecular ML pipelines. I aim to make scientific computation more interpretable, reproducible, and accessible.

🎯 Long-Term Direction

I am broadly interested in how machine learning can serve as a methodological extension of theoretical chemistry, and in building systems that help researchers navigate data, models, and mechanistic hypotheses with greater clarity and speed.
